## YourBourse Candidate Evaluation (QA Automation)

Your task is to create a small working automation framework using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/).

The framework should run against a public PetStore3 API (the definition can be found here: [Swagger UI] (https://petstore3.swagger.io/))
and execute the required test cases.

## Scope

1. Prepare a list of test cases covering three operations:

   - Create a pet `/pet`

   - Modify the existing pet `/pet`

   - Search for the specified pet by a tag `/pet/findByTag`

2. Create a test framework that can be executed, and it should verify that all test cases are adequately handled.

3. API calls should be made from Cypress using application/json content type
